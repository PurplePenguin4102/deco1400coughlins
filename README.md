Hey Guys

So the organisation of everything was a little bad before, so I've come up with a new way.

- DO NOT MODIFY STYLE.CSS unless you /really/ have to. If you do, TELL ME IMMEDIATELY
- DO YOUR CSS STYLING IN A DIFFERENT STYLE SHEET AND LINK IT in addition to styles.css
- I've put up templates for what everyone should be able to do by the end of the week.
- look through the folder for things with your name on it and do that
- when you are done either submit a pull request or send it to me directly
- When you submit a pull request, make sure you include any stylesheet you made
