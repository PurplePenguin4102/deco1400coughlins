Hey Guys

The organisation of everything was a little ehh before, so I've come up with a new way.

- DO NOT MODIFY STYLE.CSS unless you /really/ have to. If you do, TELL ME IMMEDIATELY
- DO YOUR CSS STYLING IN A DIFFERENT STYLE SHEET AND LINK IT in addition to styles.css
- I've put up templates for what everyone should be able to do by the end of the week.
- look through the folder for things with your name on it and do that
- when you are done either submit a pull request or send it to me directly
- When you submit a pull request, make sure you include any stylesheet you made

Steps to Success!

i clone this repo in your harddrive (either download the zip or clone it properly)
ii click through every file and note the ones where I've said <!-- (YOUR NAME) DO THIS -->
iii Complete the file as you see fit (use the mockups and the original site to guide you)
iv When you're happy submit a pull request or send me a message on facebook with the files you want to put in

Notes from fixing stuff:

- don't forget to adjust line-height to space the lines out properly
- Billy let me fix contact.html
- in the end: go with what you think looks good.
